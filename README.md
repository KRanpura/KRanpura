## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Khushi! I'm a May 2025 graduate of Rutgers University, where I obtained my B.S in Computer Science (and a double major in English). As of now, as I expand my skillset, I'm also looking for roles in Software Development and Cloud Engineering.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning cloud technologies- I'm AWS CCP certified and am working towards the AWS SAA and the DVA. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Severance (the TV show), Severance (the unrelated novel by Ling Ma), and how many national parks I've been to!
