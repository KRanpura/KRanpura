## Hi there 👋

Hey, I'm Khushi! I'm a May 2025 graduate of Rutgers University, where I obtained my B.S in Computer Science (and a double major in English). As of now, as I expand my skillset post-college through personal projects and certifications, I'm also looking for roles in Software Development and Cloud Engineering.   

- 🔭 As a Software Developer at Rutgers, I’m currently building web apps for Douglass Faculty Fellow Program research projects
- 🌱 I’m learning cloud technologies- I'm AWS CCP certified and am working towards the AWS SAA and the DVA. 
- 💬 Ask me about Severance (TV show), Severance (unrelated novel by Ling Ma), and how many national parks I've been to!
- 📫 To reach me, email me at ranpurakhushi@gmail.com or reach out on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/kcranpura/
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm writing a book!
